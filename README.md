# lodash v4.2.1

The [lodash](https://lodash.com/) library exported as a [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) module.

Generated using [lodash-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash-cli):
```bash
$ npm run build
$ lodash -o ./dist/lodash.js
$ lodash core -o ./dist/lodash.core.js
```

## What is lodash?

Lodash is a collection, or library, of task-specific methods (helper functions) which facilitate functional programming in JavaScript.  
Why is that needed? Many common tasks in programming require a lot of code to be written and can sometimes appear very unreadable, making the code harder to reason about and therefore more prone to errors. Lodash breaks many common tasks down into reusable methods which can be used individually, or as building blocks to assemble more complex solutions. The Lodash library makes working on those common tasks much easier with its simplified and straightforward syntax. For developers who work on a large and complex project, using these tested and pre-built methods can reduce coding time and effort while yielding more modular and readable code. This frees developers to work on other unique problems in a project.  

The name "Lodash", or "Lo-Dash" is a short for "lower dash", a character "_" used by this library to bind its methods to.  

## What lodash is used for and when to use it:  

Specifically, the lodash library of specialized, task-specific functions, written in JavaScript, can be used for manipulating and iterating over arrays, strings, objects and collections while delivering modularity, performance, and consistency, with its thoroughly-tested methods. It covers gaps that exist in the JavaScript language itself. Another feature of lodash is that it is customizable with regard to build - it allows you to control every aspect of the library. You can mix and match individual functions to create a build to suit your exact needs. Loadash allows computations such as producing unique arrays, or intersections of collections, to be performed almost effortlessly. It makes functional programming - programming using smaller, easier-to-think-about function components, in composite, to produce more broad and complex solutions - easier and more readable. Lodash can be used when high-performance is a consideration - it is made to be performant using sensible performance-achieving principles. The criteria for overall optimal performance is not simply speed-based, but balanced with other considerations in mind - result correctness, use context, common case use, and to counteract the costs associated with making Lodash extremely cross-browser consistent. Yet due to successful efforts to optimize component methods and their order of implementation, the speed performance of lodash often exceeds functionally-similar native JavaScript utility options - when they exist!
